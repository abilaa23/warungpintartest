Can you explain the logging test with any response json code, for example :

200​ ​:​ API OK This is status code for succesful request, where responses are received, according to the request sent.
​400​ ​:​ ​Bad​ ​Request This is status code for request that the server cannot access due to size too large, invalid request
​404​ ​:​ ​Not​ ​Found This is status code for request not found on the server
​​500 ​​:​​ Internal​​ Server​ E​rror This is status code for request who experience unexpected condition and no special message matches
